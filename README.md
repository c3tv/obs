# C3TV OBS
This is the [C3TV](http://c3tv.de) resource for our [OBS](https://obsproject.com) scenes, widgets, graphics, and fonts.

## Instructions and tips
* _Always_ use Studio Mode while streaming.
* Our output resolution is _1920 Ã— 1080_.
* Install the fonts before importing the scenes. If you installed them while OBS was open, restart it.
* Currently you have to manually change the paths of every source (video/images/widgets), sorry for that. OBS does not seem to support relative paths without changing them in the JSON file.
* The imported text sources only work with Windows (GDI+). Alternatively, you can delete them and add new sources with Free Type 2.
* Note that the browser source is currently not available for OBS under Linux.
